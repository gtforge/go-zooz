# Currently supports only Go module defined in root repository.
#
# Current limit for open PRs is 10, which is twice the default value. I found that it is easier to
# first update dependencies that do not require manual code changes and only after that attempt to
# update remaining dependencies. Uses a bit more resources, but will go down as we merge PRs.

# TODO: Add support for Go modules in subdirectories.
# TODO: Add support for GitHub Actions.
# TODO: Add support for Docker images (need self-hosted GitHub Action runners).
